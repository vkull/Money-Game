# Money-Game
The idea that two parties compete in a skill based match with the intent on wagering money against their skills.
Think of combining poker with something skilled base like soccer-football. If you are good at something, or think you're good at something, you would want to bet money on yourself to win yes? 
There are already betting sites that allow you to set up tournements for CoD and Leage of Legends but I'm not suggesting the odd tournement here and there. I am suggesting the mechanic of 'betting on yourself to win a match' as a core mechanic of the game. 
You have two server lobbies. One is a casual lobby where no physical money is being bet (It would be nice to use in-game currency as a form of wager on casual servers. Possibly get into crypto currencies and nft's but I don't want to turn away a potential large player base because of the negetive reputation of crypto and nfts.) 
The other lobby is your ranking lobby where you bet real money. (Think of leage of legends play system between casual and ranked)
Actual gameplay and win conditions should be focused around player skill. A skilled player should be able to climb the system, win money, and possibly earn a living playing a video game. These conditions should lower the bar for "Pro Players" allowing regular people to compete and earn a living.
Emphisis on zero pay to win mechanics and little to zero random chance (again, thinking about league of legends gameplay where they try to make win condition skill based). Game should be marketed and proceived as free-to-play/pay-to-play.
Game style to be decided, I'd like to make a game for each skill based pvp genre, rts, fps.
